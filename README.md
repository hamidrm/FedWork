## FedWork

FedWork is a flexible and modular framework designed for implementing and experimenting with various federated learning algorithms. It provides a range of tools, configurations, and methods to facilitate research and development in the federated learning space.

### Overview

FedWork is designed to help researchers and developers prototype and test federated learning algorithms with ease. The framework includes a variety of pre-built architectures, communication modules, and methods that are commonly used in federated learning.

### Features

- **Modular Design:** Easily interchangeable components like neural network architectures, federated learning methods, and datasets.
- **Multiple Federated Learning Algorithms:** Implementations of various algorithms including FedAvg, FedProx, and more.
- **Customizable Configurations:** XML-based configuration files to customize experiments.
- **Built-in Visualization Tools:** Tools for monitoring and visualizing training progress.

The `non_iid_level` parameter controls how much the label distributions deviate from uniformity. A higher non-IID level leads to more variability in the class distribution among clients.
